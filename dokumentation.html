    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Before we start</h3>
    <p>
      I looked up from the screen of my iPad to my father, lying unconscious, amid tubes and wires, in his starship of a bed, in the irresolute darkness of an I.C.U. at 3 a.m. Ordinarily when my father lay on his back his abdomen rose up like the
      telescope dome of an observatory, but now there seemed to be nothing between the bed rails at all, just a blanket pulled as taut as a drum skin and then, on the pillow, my father’s big, silver-maned head. Scarecrow, after the flying monkeys
      had finished with him. His head was tilted upward and his jaw hung slack. All the darkness in the room seemed to pool in his open mouth.

      Hey, Dad, I need a line, I said, breaking, if only in my head, the silence that reigned between us. I’m writing dialogue for Mr. Spock.

    <h3>First Steps</h3>
    <p>
      I’d tried talking aloud to my father a few times in the hours since he’d lost consciousness, telling him all the things that, I’d read, you were supposed to tell a dying parent. There was never any trace of a response. No twitch of an eye or a
      cheek, no ghost of a tender or rueful smile. I wanted to believe that he’d heard me, heard that I loved him, that I forgave him, that I was thankful to him for having taught me to love so many of the things I loved most, “Star Trek” among
      them, but it felt like throwing a wish and a penny into a dry fountain. My father and I had already done all the talking we were ever going to do.

      Can’t help you there, said my father, a pediatrician, though long retired from practice. Now, if you were writing dialogue for Doctor Spock . . .

      My father had slipped into unconsciousness twelve hours earlier, about an hour after we stopped the intravenous adrenaline that had been keeping his blood pressure up. Until then, he’d been responsive, aware, irritable, funny, querulous, weak,
      confused, furious, loopy, but recognizably himself. A studied, even militant avoider of exercise all his life, he had been seriously overweight for most of the past forty years, diabetic for a decade. His kidneys were failing. So was his
      liver. The latest enemy was acute hypotension, which when untreated would drop him into the scary nether regions of the mmHg scale. But the norepinephrine drip that could magically restore my father to a close approximation of the man we
      remembered was likely to put him into cardiac arrest. His caregivers had gently and regretfully begun to suggest that it might be time to stop treating this particular element among the complex of things that were killing him. A heart attack
      would be painful and frightening.</p>
